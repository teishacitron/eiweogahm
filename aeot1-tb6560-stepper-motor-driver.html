                            <p> Hi there, I’ve been trying to build a CNC router for more than a year now and it would be great if someone could help with some CNC machinist wisdom. I am using NEMA 17 Stepper motors (because this should have been a cheap CNC router initially) with threaded rods, an Arduino with GRBL and TB6560 stepper motor drivers (upgraded from A4988 drivers, had the same problem there). 24V, full steps (because of the torque) 1.9A. My problem is that my stepper motor is losing steps when it’s turning. Hi All, I am trying to improve the performance of my TB6560 Stepper Motor Driver Board (found here ( by following the instructions (found here ( or here ( which detail the addition I bought a Chinese board on Amazon ( and wired up all my steppers, but I can't get them to move. I'm pretty frustrated with the board and lack of quality documentation, so I want to abandon it entirely and buy something else that's easier to work with. What is the best driver board for NEMA 17/23 steppers? I want something easy to work with, hopefully just plug-and-play I'm trying to build a CNC router after finishing my 3d printer, but I'm not completely understanding the electronics. So far on my list is stepper motors for the 3 axis, 3 tb6560 drivers and an arduino to control it all (planning on using grbl firmware) Is this all i'd need to get it up and running? I used RAMPS 1.4 for my 3d printer, but am not sure if some kind of similar shield for the arduino would be needed. I read a bit about breakout boards, but I'm not completely sure why I shouldn't. I'm currently building a robotic arm, but all my components are commonly used in 3D Printers so I figured this is the best place to ask. I'm using Ramps 1.4 with Arduino Mega 2560 and TB6560 stepper drivers. The TB6560 and the stepper motors are able to operate at 24V, but the Ramps and Arduino aren't. I know Ramps can be converted to 24V and Arduino can be disconnected from it. But I want to find out if I am able to supply 24V to the TB6560 (for stepper motors) and have a DC-DC Hello, I'd like to show you the project that I realized with my students. https://i.redd.it/s7eglz4ivx711.jpg Here's the "making of" video of this 1 meter long mechanical beast Made with metallic pieces recovered from an old dishwasher, it reacts from movements around it giving the impression that it can interact with its surrounding.

I've wired up my stepper drivers(TB6560) with my Arduino UNO and when i use a selfmade code to turn the motors everything is working properly. But as soon as i flash the Arduino with GRBL and try to send some G1 commands the motors won't turn. They are getting power as they are holding the axle. My homemade code uses the same pins as GRBL. Thanks in advance Hi guys I'm new to Reddit also to Arduino 😅 . I'm an interior designer and I love photography . I know very little about electronics ,I wanted to make a slider for timelapse photography with pan amp tilt head for my Cannon 650d dslr . Now here is the problem, l bought three stepper motors one is nema 23 3 amp bipolar stepper with TB6560 stepper driver to hookup to Arduino uno for sliding motion with no problem in connections or working . The other two for the head are (STP-42D2022) my stepper motor has this kind of hiccup thing happening, i tested multiple speeds and it always happens, even at the lowest speeds, you cant see it happening, but you can hear and feel it if you touch the motor, so i would like to know what could cause this to happen ? voltage ? amperage ? motor drivers ? (Tb6560), im using mach3 to control them, could it be possible that the computer has these small freezes and the motors freeze along with the PC ? its an old PC. i mean, if the pc has a micros. I'm fairly new to the world of CNC and machining but I'm an experienced electronics engineer. I was hoping folks here can share some of their experiences on Toshiba's TB6600 stepper driver (not the cheap chinese fully assembled driver boards but the chip itself). Good? Bad? Meh? I was also reading posts here and on the web about another driver called TB6560 but Toshiba seems to have discontinued it since I cannot find it on their site (https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/eu/product/linear/motor. Hello! I'm looking at building a 3 axis router that can do a little bit of everything upto and including aluminium. I had initially planned to build a small laser engraver and so I purchased a few items that I have cobbled together just as a proof of concept - I have an Arduino Uno running GRBL connected to three TB6560 single channel drivers, each attached to a NEMA17 motor. So far I can successfully send gcode to GRBL and have the motors move in the appropriate manner, so I'm satisfied. Hey guys, I have a need to push a paper forward about 2 inches, stop, then push it forward 2 inches and stop, and continuing repeating like 8 times, then pull it back. I'd like to do this relatively quick, like, pushing it foward in less than a second, and pull it back the roughly 16 inches in maybe a 2-3 seconds. The motor/setup I have is as follows: I have these: Controller: Arduino Uno Motor: longs stepper motor 23hs8430 Driver: HY-DIV-268N-5A OR Driver: TB6560 Picture 1. (https. I was hoping folks here can share some of their experiences on Toshiba's TB6600 stepper driver (not the cheap chinese fully assembled driver boards but the chip itself). Good? Bad? Meh? Essentially I was looking for something that has the ability to drive high current motors with higher micro-stepping abilities. I was also reading posts here and on the web about another driver called TB6560 but Toshiba seems to have discontinued it since I cannot find it on their site (https://toshiba.semicon-s. 
Just recent bought a cheap tb6550 for 50 bucks on amazon. I was able to wire it and get it going with mach 3. My x axis motor started stuttering so i figured i would replace the y plug with the x plug and see if there was any difference between the two. After i did that the chip on the bottom of the circuit fried. The set up i have is a sherling 5000 mill. The person that sold it to me has the computer that sherline provides for the cnc mill. I was willing to pay for the computer today. I plugg. I have been designing a CNC machine for some time now and for the longest time I was up in the air between three major constraints: Cost, Quality, Rigidity. If in the design process I felt that cost was too much I would always find myself taking away from one of the other two constraints. Eight concepts later I think and I am on track with a design that is largely in part from the result of endless hours on the internet and CAD design / running simulations. To give a basic layout Which is the best for a Hobby CNC? I've got an Arduino Uno R3 and a Raspberry Pi 1 Model B, along with this stepper motor driver ( My initial idea involved using both, the RPi for GUI interfacing, with the Arduino and motor driver handling the rest. While trying to figure out the best way to interface with a DB25 parallel port, I came across a few options that only involved either Basically I'm tired of the way Grbl behaves and looking for something more configurable. I'm thinking of switching to Mach3 and using a parallel port and something like this ( to drive the steppers. Has anyone here made the switch? So, I recently found an XY stage on Ebay. I've now started to play with it and had a choice of stepper drivers to use. I thought you guys might be interested in the results. The paths aren't quite the same for both videos, but both drivers are tuned as well as I can make them using Stepconf and LinuxCNC.

Hello all r/hobbycnc'ists! Been lurking here long time and secretly building my own CNC at the same time! Hehe! But now I found time to post it here. Well, this project is I think at least 2 years old, if not more. Been planning this for fun and thought different kind of versions in my head and drew with SketchUp and AutoCad. But then, at last, around last christmas I thought to give this a try for real and ordered material from local vocational school and got the assembly going. Hello r/cnc!

Our main character, StepperBot, is “instructed” to move in a square path on my coffee table, making 90 degree turns. Hi everybody, I stumbled over TB6600 stepper motor controller on the eBay. Since there was little documentation describing how to interface this controller. The Latest 3rd Generation Standard TB6560 3 Axis Stepper Driver Box Set (TB3CD-S (Box) ). of the computer, and thenrerun the recorded G-code to make the stepper motor. 
A high voltage rating on a stepper motor like the 8.6 volts is an indication the speed will be very limited and torque will fall off rapidly. Steppers.
