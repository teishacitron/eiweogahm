I've just bought the A2A Comanche in the Christmas sale after having enjoyed the Cherokee a lot over the last few months. The only problem I've got is that at full throttle it will only hit 1300RPM and stay there. I have automixture turned off and no issues of this sort with any other planes. Has anyone else encountered.

Thanks in advance. what do you use for realistic versions of GA planes? and do you use FSX or something. Just having some fun after making the MD11 Series videos. Not to serious just good old stick and rudder flying. However after loading up XP11 and spending some time creating lots of Ortho for the US and UK I now have an awesome looking simulator that performs better than anything other, than DCS. I'll still fly P3Dv4 as Orbx and PMDG have lots of my money, but a Carenado Cessna with REP or free Xebo 737, a great flight model and Ortho is an amazing combination. I'm now firmly in the X-Plane camp, if not exclusively so. My free 737 over my recognisable home town (https://i.imgur.com/ovsqIfU.jpg).

My parents got me a yoke/TrackIR setup for Christmas for use with Flight Simulator X. I've always wanted to learn how to fly, but since I'm in college and currently laden with student debt, getting my PPL simply isn't in the cards right now. That being said, I know that my new setup can give me something resembling what it's like to actually be flying, so I wanted to try and learn the principles of flying through using Flight Simulator Whats the shortest "route" (game =gt patch =gt mod / payed addon) I could take? Which flightsim would fit the most? Thanks in advance. 
FSX - A2A B377 full pack, Captain of the ship, includes update. I have dialed everything down as far as they can go (very nearly literally), and I still have fps issues with A2A's C172 unless I'm in the middle of a desert with a clear blue sky. I'm trying to use it for IFR training, so it's pretty rare that I want to just do pattern work at some private field in the middle of no where. Additionally, when the fps drops, the CPU-heavy autopilot goes nuts. I just had it try to correct a few hundred feet of over-shoot by diving at probably 3 or 4 thousand. High quality add-on aircraft for Flight Simulator X and Prepar3D from the team at A2A Simulations. One thing I haven't seen too much of in here are flight engineer panels. Does anyone take on captain, first officer, and flight engineer at once? What model has the most realistic panel and systems. After the recent release of A2A Simulations' 3D Lights, we got several requests from the community for a tutorial on how to install this unique feature in add-on aircraft. 
So, I’m a long time FSX user, heck I started my flight sim hobby back in FS 4.0 when I was a kid \(thank you, Dad\) and it has just grown from there. Now a days, I have a FSX SE with many an addon paid and free, making my FSX basically customized to my preferred level of realism in the world. I’ve also tweaked the heck out of the planes I fly the most with the CFG files, and with the in game settings to get to my preferred level of realism in flight. Then for kicks and giggles I installed. Turn ON the LIGHTS for Microsoft Flight Simulator X Shockwave 3D LightsTM REDUX cast realistic light out into 3D space creating stunning visuals and a more immersive flying experience FEATURES Over 40 new lighting effects including strobes beacons navigation and runway lights Fully-realized. After reading about the new C182 for FSX and P3D I am considering switching from X-Plane to P3D. Especially the persistence-features seem incredible. Does anything like this exist for XP10? It feels like most Payware planes just look a lot nicer, but perform similar to the standard or free models. XP10 is supposed to have the better flight model, but "maintenance" simulation, in the sense that you might damage the plane by operating it wrongly, seems nonexistent. Add a touch of Accu-Sim to your FSX:Steam Edition fleet!Accu-Feel enables you to customize numerous aspects of your aircraft's behaviour, from the level of turbulence and drag rumble experienced in different flying conditions to the amount of tyre screech on touchdown. Im new to sims. I'm working on my PPL right now and radio communications is a sticking point for me. I signed up with PilotEdge to do some practicing. Unfortunately I cant accurately change radio frequencies in this cessna. In the default cessna if you move the mouse over the numbers you get a hand(+) or hand(-). I dont get that in the A2A cessna. Any ideas. A2A Simulations Accu-Sim Bonanza for FSX - on sale from the Just Flight website. I feel like I am finally getting somewhere with my setup. Running FSXSE. Just added HOTAS and trackir, most recently pedals. I am planning on pursuing a pilots license IRL soon. I'm not broke or wealthy, but I have a family to support so computer stuff can't be too high on the list of expenses. All that being said, would I possibly see improvements in texture loading using ORBX PNW area if I upgraded to SSD? Has anyone made that upgrade from HDD and seen worthwhile improvements? I'm just using.
